Help! Can you guide Pikachu back to its pokeball?

#### Controls:

A: left tiny acceleration

D: Right tiny acceleration

You get one big acceleration boost so choose your direction wisely! It will knock you into tiles if you aren't careful.

Right Arrow key: Right big boost acceleration

Left Arrow key: Left big boost acceleration

Be careful! I purposefully do not reset your horizontal acceleration so sometimes you have to be deft enough to know when to let go of the button and let Pikachu continue accelerating. This also means that direction change isn't immediate. 

This makes the game a lot more challenging and it took me many tries to guide Pikachu to its home...either that or I'm bad at my own game haha!
